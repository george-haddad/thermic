Fully functioning thermal imaging app running on the CAT S60 Phone

# Introduction

This android app project was created so as a playground for testing the CAT S60 thermal imaging phone's capabilities. Getting the FLIR SDK to work on the CAT S60 on the latest Android API was a challenge by itself. Official SDK docs not mentioning how to handle the internal thermal camera and only providing robust application example for detachable thermal devices. I thought this would benefit other developers who struggle trying to figure out how to get started.

# Contributing

It would be kick ass if other FLIR SDK developers would want to contribute anything they want to this code base. The idea is to learn from each other and encourage best practices.

# License

This has not really crossed my mind, but BSD 3 Clause license seems cool. For now it's public domain
